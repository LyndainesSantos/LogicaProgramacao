# Programming Logical

This is a brief logic problem solving using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript) as a programming language. The questions came from my period of learning studies as a specialist in programming for mobile devices in graduate school at the Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Piau√≠ ([IFPI](https://www.ifpi.edu.br/)).

#### The files were performed at :

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en) and

- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

## To Install
You can run the following commands to install Node.js and NPM, respectively:

First to update the ubuntu, run:
```
sudo apt update
````
And then:
```
sudo apt install nodejs
````

```
sudo apt install npm
````

To be sure if the node and npm are installed you can see the version of them through the commands bellow:

```
node -v
````

```
npm -v
````

## To Run

Since the goal is to exercise logic programming, the scripts show the result in the terminal, some require user input to show the output and others already have the value defined.

To run the script q01.js, you just need to run:

```
node q01.js
````

## Observations

There are several ways to get the result for the same problem, these are just one way I found to build them. So feel free to test and improve these files in your own way.
